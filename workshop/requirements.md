## Workshop requirements

This document contains important information about the workshop, including
software which must be installed prior to arrival.

You will also receive a copy of the notes by email two weeks before the
workshop, and a printed copy on the day of the workshop.

If you have any technical questions about the workshop, or there are any
particular areas which you would like us to spend more time on, please let the
tutor know via email: [paul@phpdeveloper.org.uk](mailto:paul@phpdeveloper.org.uk).

In order to complete all the exercises, you will need to have installed Git
version 2.6 or later. You will also need the ability to run Git on the command
line, for example using Git Bash in Windows.

Linux users can install Git through their distribution's package manager.

macOS users can install Git through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

Windows users can download the latest version of Git from
[git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This website also has
the latest versions for Linux and macOS, should you want them.
